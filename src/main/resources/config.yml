authentication:
  # The method used to determine if the player is using one of the listed auth servers.
  # If falsely recognized user as premium, the user will be disconnected but the next time they join, they will be able to login via password
  # If falsely recognized user as offline, the user will just need to use password authentication.
  # Can be: UUID, REQUEST, AUTO
  # UUID: Only recognize uuid patterns (works for PCL and launchers that supports the Bukkit-styled UUID format (Such as HMCL) )
  # REQUEST: Send a request to the listed auth servers to check if the player is premium (Cached). Usually always works but will take longer.
  # AUTO: Only send requests when necessary, otherwise use caches or UUID methods.

  # ONLY CHOOSE REQUEST/AUTO IF YOU ARE FACING CASES WHERE UUID DOESN'T WORK!
